# Conversions

In this lab you will use variables and expressions, along with input / output, and string concatenation.

You will also be introduced to a control structure called an if statement.

You will provide the user a list of 10 conversions (really 5 conversions but they can be performed in both directions)

The user's selection will be an integer selection (a numnber between 1 and 10) and will be stored in an integer variable.

Then your code will look at the value of that integer variable, and depending on the value (that the user chose) a different conversion will be performed.
